The `listener` listens\n * for inputs or changes to the `element` and passes the new value on to to the\n * `checker` which performs its checks and passes the the results on to the\n * `checkHandler` which calculates the new state of the `element` which it\n * passes on to the `domNode` which will update the dom.\n *\n * The four main parts, the listener, the checker, the checkHandler, and the\n * domNode all communicate through the `mediator` by firing events identified\n * by a unique id. They do not know of each other's existance, and so no\n * communication flows directly between them.\n *\n * All listeners, checkers, handlers, and domNodes are grouped together in\n * `collections`, which are basically a glorified array that makes it easy\n * not to get duplicate items for each element (for instance two listeners\n * listening to the same element).\n *\n * The communication flow looks like this:\n * listener -> checker -> checkHandler -> domNode\n *\n * Between each part, you have the mediator.\n *\n *\n * `Metrics` are added by the user, which sets up the system above.
